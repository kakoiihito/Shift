## Shift: The Car Simulatior

  ### Highlights
  * Ready to use vehicle dynamics
  * Physics derived from the real formulas
  * 60 Hz engine

  ### Overview

  Shift is a vehicle  simulator made in the Godot 4.6 engine attempting to offer top level physics. Made by a broke highschool student, I'm a kid interested in motorsports, attempting to understand them at a deeper level. Shift was made as an alternative to motorsports simulators open to anyone to improve, work on, use for projects, and play for free unlike the others
