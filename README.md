  ### Overview

Shift is a vehicle  simulator made in the Godot 4.6 engine attempting to offer top level physics. Made by a broke highschool student, I'm a kid interested in motorsports, attempting to understand them at a deeper level. Shift was made as an alternative to motorsports simulators open to anyone to improve, work on, use for projects, and use for free unlike the others
